"Flying a kite can be dangerous. When I was eight years old I went to the park with my dad to fly my new kite. We stood on the top of a hill and tried to catch the wind. It took us almost half an hour, but we finally got the kite into the air. As it lifted into the sky, the kite caught the edge of my jacket and I was pulled up into the wind with the kite. I flew higher and higher into the air until I my dad looked like an ant on the ground. The park was beautiful from up high, and I could see our car getting smaller. I flew all the way out of the city and over the lake. Eventually, the wind started to die down and I fell closer to the water. I called out to some people on a boat and they sailed over so I could land on their boat. I told them about my adventure and they sailed me back to land, where my dad picked me up. He took me out for ice cream and we went home. Who was the main character flying a kite with?",Her father,Her aunt,Her mother,Her brother,A

"The first grade class went on a bus to visit a farm. The farm was a long ways from their school. The farm was also far away from any other farms or houses. The farmers who lived there were the Nixon family. They grew corn. Sometimes when the weather was right, they would plant wheat, too. The fields were so large that the class could not see where they ended. Mr. Nixon gave all of the children a long ride in the fields on his tractor. The Nixon family also had a lot of farm animals. In the red barn next to their home, they kept a few cows and horses. Everyone fed hay to some of the cows. The farmers got milk from their cows. Some of the class got small bottles of fresh milk to take home with them. All the kids got to ride on the big brown horses the Nixons had. They went up into the nearby hills, where they could look down on the farm below. Around the farmyard there were many goats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished. The Nixon children liked to play with their goats, feed them peanut shells and pet them, like the first grade kids did with their dogs and cats. The smallest tried to bump the children with their hard heads and tiny horns! When it was almost dark, the school kids got back on the bus to go home. They were a little sad to leave the fun life of the farm children. But they brought back stories for all the rest of the school to hear. What did some of the class get to take home, other than stories?",corn,peanuts,chickens,milk,D

"I used to be afraid of butterflies!  It is true!  Once, my mom took me to Seattle.  There, we went to a special place.  We went to the zoo!  I saw lots of animals at the zoo.  I saw bears.  I saw tigers.  I saw apes.  I saw monkeys.  I saw snakes.  I loved seeing all these animals.  They made me happy.  We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they didn't even scare me.  In fact, I like bugs.  But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there were lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.  You could buy sugar water to feed them and they could land on you.  My mom and brother were so excited to go in, but I was scared.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying everywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They said butterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in the room.  Guess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door! The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me to stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said I was sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of there!  I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.  Since then, they would tease me about being afraid.  They would try and get me to not be afraid.  Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.  She bought one for my brother, too.  I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find butterflies with my brother.  It became really fun to do.  Once, a butterfly landed on me and I laughed.  I liked it.  It tickled me.  It did not hurt me.  Now, I like butterflies! Where did the child go when he saw the butterflies?",To the movie,To school,In the car,To the zoo in Seattle,D

"Chocolate was a box turtle.  Lauren found her one day on the side of the road, hiding in her old, worn shell, frightened by the cars going by.  Lauren picked Chocolate up to help her cross the street, because Lauren knew that turtles are very slow and cars are very fast.  After Lauren got Chocolate to the other side of the road, Chocolate peeked her head out of her shell and looked at the little girl.  Lauren saw that not only was Chocolate's shell worn, one of her eyes was shut.  Lauren thought Chocolate needed more help from her, so Lauren took the turtle home.

"Mary was a little girl who loved to sew. She liked to sew dresses, shirts, and skirts but Mary hated to sew quilts. She didn't like anything about sewing quilts and blankets because it took too long. One quilt or blanket took a week to make, when a skirt or shirt took one night! Mary's mother didn't understand why Mary didn't like to sew quilts and blankets because Mary's mother loved to!  Mary was a normal little girl even if her friends didn't think so all the time. Mary's friends liked to play games and play outside but all Mary liked was to sew. She woke up and she began to sew. She only stopped to eat and use the bathroom. Mary's father was very worried about Mary. He said that little girls needed to laugh and play, not sew all the time.   One day Mary's father took Mary's sewing things and gave them to the poor children. ""No more sewing, Mary!"" He said. He wanted her to go laugh and play with her friends instead of sew but instead of going outside to play she ran into her room and cried. Mary was very sad that she couldn't sew any more. Soon her friends came over to see why Mary hadn't come over to play like her father said she would. When they saw her crying on her bed they had to think of a way to cheer her up. Billy said that maybe they could let her sew at their houses. Abby thought it was a great idea. So then all Mary's friends bought sewing things with their money so that Mary would be happy again.

On the way out, his mother told him, ""Remember to wear your helmet,"" and Freddy grabbed his helmet and met his friends outside.  When he was putting on his helmet, his friends told him, ""Helmets are for girls!  You're not cool if you wear a helmet!""

He told her how we would never do that again, and how he would always wear his helmet.  His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and Freddy knew his mother was right in the beginning.

He had never ridden down this hill before.  His friends said, ""What are you, scared?""  Freddy did not want to come off as scared.  He hopped on his bicycle, and down he went.  Freddy started speeding up, going very, very fast.  He pressed his brakes, but oh no, his brakes weren't working.  Freddy, speeding down the hill, did not know what to do.  He got to the end of the hill and slammed right into a tree.  He awoke the next day in the hospital.  At the hospital, his mother was there.  Freddy opened his eyes and told his mom the whole story.  He told her how we would never do that again, and how he would always wear his helmet.  His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and Freddy knew his mother was right in the beginning.  She didn't have to say it.  In the end, Freddy learned that it's important to not care what other people think, and those that think you're not cool because you wear a helmet are the ones that aren't cool in the first place. In which two places is this story located?",Neighborhood and Hospital,Neighborhood and Shopping Mall,Hospital and the Zoo,Restaurant and Shopping Mall,A

"Late in the evening, the wind blew hard around the little house. The sound of the wind is like someone crying. It made the old woman nervous.

""Hey, you look like you need some fun,"" he said.  ""Want to go fishing?"" I said sure, and he went to the garage.  He came out with two poles, some hooks, and some fishing line. Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together.  I asked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river.  It was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and the store, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve. They used to catch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner.  When we got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned and walked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees right at the edge of the park. There, he taught me how to throw my line in the water. Then we sat down to wait. While we were fishing, my grandfather told me lots of stories about what he and Steve did as kids. We didn't have any worms, so we never caught any fish, but sitting there as he told me stories made it a great afternoon. What did they walk past?",Park,River,Garage,Library and store,D

I walked to the back of the store and picked up some cold sodas and a bottle of orange juice. I then went and picked up some popcorn. This would be good for eating later while watching tv. I then went to the dog food section and picked a meat treat for the dog. I then went up to the front of the store and paid Mr. Jones. He smiled and thanked me for shopping at his store. Then I walked back to my house and looked at the dog. His name was Rex and had lived with us for around four years. His coat was brown and white. I unwrapped the dog treat and gave it to him.

"Joey got a German Shepherd for his birthday present. He had never had any pets before, but was always excited to see the other dogs and cats in his neighborhood. Since his birthday was in June, he spent a lot of time playing outside with his new puppy, which he named Max. Max and Joey would often run through fields in a game of chase. They also liked to go through the small forest behind the house, making a game of hide and seek. They never went near the lake because Joey was afraid of water. One day, Max hid a little too well and Joey couldn't find him. Joey spent the afternoon looking for his German Shepherd where they often played, like the field and forest. Joey was a shy boy who often read by himself, and Max was his best friend.  After dinner, he went to look for Max one last time before he had to take a bath and go to bed. He heard some barking on the next street, so he ran to see if it was his puppy. Sure enough, he saw Max playing with a poodle. The dogs were having so much fun. Joey brought Max home, happy that he had his puppy back. Max seemed to be happy to have his human by his side as well as a new doggy friend. All summer long, Joey took Max to the poodle's house so they could play without having to worry about losing his present.

"John thought about things that he liked to do.  Well, for one, he liked baseball. Compared to his friends, he was very good at the sport. He didn't even have to practice that much. He remembered that he once hit the ball so hard that it flew out of the park. Home run!  He was also a fan of basketball. He enjoyed watching people on television pull off crazy tricks like slam dunking (but he didn't really like all of the passes). He wasn't quite that good yet, but he was pretty good at making shots from the three point line. He knew that if he kept practicing, he would be really great someday.  Finally, he loved football. Unlike baseball and basketball, he didn't play football himself, but he was drawn to the games. He got a kick out of sitting in the stands, cheering on his team and friends. He once cheered so loud that he could barely speak at all for the rest of the day. Based on what John likes to do, what else do you think John would enjoy?",Reading,Cooking,Soccer,Watching television,C

He was moving his head back and forward to some music that he was playing when a spider dropped on his ice-cream for a little bite.

My dad made the spider leave and right after that he saw an alligator come running up to him wanting a bite of his ice-cream too! My dad dropped his cone, ran away, and bought a yoghurt instead.

My dad saw right away that a spider was on it and he brushed the spider off. After the spider was put on the floor, a fly flew into his ice-cream, right where the spider had been! Oh how terrible! My dad made the spider leave and right after that he saw an alligator come running up to him wanting a bite of his ice-cream too! My dad dropped his cone, ran away, and bought a yoghurt instead. He thought about buying a dingdong, but since dinner time was so close and he had such a big lunch, he thought a yoghurt would be better. It's a much safer and better dessert.    165 words. In what order did the animals meet my dad?","First fly, then pig, then alligator","First fly, then spider, then alligator.","First spider, then fly, and then alligator","First alligator, then spider, then fly.",C

"It was a hot Saturday afternoon, and James was going shopping with his mother. While she made her shopping list, James looked out the window. In the sky, he saw pretty birds. He smiled - James liked birds. He saw one last Friday when he was getting muddy in the puddles, and another on Wednesday when he was playing with his toy spaceship.  Once his mother was done making her list, James got his shoes on before getting in the car. ""Should I bring my jacket, Mom?"" he asked.   ""No,"" his mother answered, fixing his hair, ""it is warmer today than it was yesterday, in fact, it's hot!"" James and his mother got in the car, and drove off to the store. He leaned his head on the car window, looking at the animals and trees they passed. He saw flowers, a puppy, ants, and people walking, and even a chipmunk!   When they got to the store, James and his mother grabbed an empty shopping cart. James always liked helping his mother do her shopping - she sometimes let him get a treat if he was good. They went up and down the aisles, picking up the things on the list, including James' favorite food - peanut butter - and James was very well behaved. As they finished their shopping and walked to the front of the store in order to pay, James' mother said, ""James, you can get a candy bar if you'd like, so I can say 'thank you' for being a super good helper today.""  James was so excited. He picked one with peanuts and chocolate, and placed it with the rest of their items.   When they got home, James spent the rest of the day playing Legos in his room. It was a good day. Did James get a treat? What kind was it?","Yes, a plane","No, he threw a temper tantrum.","Yes, a candy bar with peanuts and chocolate","No, but he wanted one with peanut butter.",C

John would eat peaches in the morning for breakfast, in the afternoon for lunch, and in the evening for dinner. John and his best friend, Rick, shared their love for peaches. One day John and Rick started a peach farm so that they would never run out of their favorite fruit. They planted hundreds of peach trees and waited for them to bear fruit. After 6 years of waiting, 1 lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees John and Rick planted. They picked the peach and brought it home. They waited until the weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did. John and Rick were sad and confused about their farm. They planted hundreds of trees and were sure that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time. Another peach never grew on their farm for 17 years. One day, a mighty crack of thunder led to a strong storm. Lightning hit the ground over and over, and John and Rick were scared their trees might be killed.

"There was once an old tree. The children from all around the neighborhood loved to climb the tree. The children also liked to sit under the tree, hang on it and play games around it. Animals liked the tree as well. Birds, cats and all kinds of lizards would climb the tree too! Rabbits, dogs, frogs and and many ground animals loved to play around the bottom of the tree.  One day the children learned the tree was going to be cut down. This made the children, and maybe the animals, very sad. Why was it being cut down? Was it too old? Too weak? Maybe it was dying? The children learned it was because the tree was sick.  The children were very sad to hear about this. They wondered where they would play from now on. The tree was their favorite place and they didn't want to see it go. One little boy, named John, went home to tell his parents the story. His parents could tell he was sad so they told him something that made him very happy. What was it? He wondered. Was a jungle gym going to be put in? A mall, maybe a park? In fact, even better than that, a new tree would be planted in its place.  John was so happy he rushed off to tell his friends. ""Big news!"", he shouted.

"There was once an old tree. The children from all around the neighborhood loved to climb the tree. The children also liked to sit under the tree, hang on it and play games around it. Animals liked the tree as well. Birds, cats and all kinds of lizards would climb the tree too! Rabbits, dogs, frogs and and many ground animals loved to play around the bottom of the tree.  One day the children learned the tree was going to be cut down. This made the children, and maybe the animals, very sad. Why was it being cut down? Was it too old? Too weak? Maybe it was dying? The children learned it was because the tree was sick.  The children were very sad to hear about this. They wondered where they would play from now on. The tree was their favorite place and they didn't want to see it go. One little boy, named John, went home to tell his parents the story. His parents could tell he was sad so they told him something that made him very happy. What was it? He wondered. Was a jungle gym going to be put in? A mall, maybe a park? In fact, even better than that, a new tree would be planted in its place.  John was so happy he rushed off to tell his friends. ""Big news!"", he shouted.

"It was a terrible day to live in the zoo again for Pauly. It wasn't a terrible day for Zip, the monkey next to him, or Garth, the giraffe down the sidewalk, or Pat, the alligator in the pond, or for Bam the prairie dog, but it was a terrible day in the monkey cage for Pauly. Pauly didn't feel he belonged in the monkey cage because he wasn't a monkey. He was a sailor who had visited the zoo on vacation and fallen asleep on a bench right before closing time. The zoo worker saw how hairy he was and thought he was a monkey that had escaped from his cage, so they put him in a cage. Pauly knew if he didn't sleep so deep, none of this would have happened.   He tried to tell the zoo worker the next morning he wasn't a monkey, but the zoo worker knew monkeys liked to play tricks and thought Pauly was a talking monkey that was trying to trick him. Soon, the zoo worker told others about the talking monkey, and Pauly became famous. People came from all over to see him. When the zoo was closed at night Pauly passed the time teaching the real monkeys how to sail.   One day Pauly was asking the people watching him to shave him when James, another sailor on vacation, who knew Pauly, saw him. When he did, the sailor yelled, ""That's no monkey, that's Pauly!"" The zoo worker saw his mistake and sent Pauly away with James in time to join the boat to sail home. Where was Pauly when the zoo worker saw him?",Looking at the monkeys,Sailing on a boat,Asleep on a bench,Walking down a path,C

Thomas thought that it was okay for a nine year old, but now he was ten and had to do even better. His friends Michael and Brianna were going as a ghost and angel, but Thomas wanted something that was both scary and real.

"Max was a little dog that loved to ride the train. Every day when the sun came up Max would run down to the stop and wait until the train stopped and jump on. He thought this was the best time of his life. He always wore a blue collar and a red piece of fabric. Except for on the weekends he would wear a green collar. Sometimes when Max would run next to the train, he would get a splash of mud on his fur. His friend, Bob, didn't like it when Max came home dirty. If Max came home with mud on his fur, Bob would make him sleep outside for the night, but if Max came home clean he would sleep in the house.

"Elizabeth jumped right out of bed on Saturday morning.  Today was the day her father was going to take her and her sister, Rebecca, to the zoo.  Her mother made them biscuits and eggs for breakfast.  The two girls were too excited to sit still.  They didn't even watch any cartoons before they left for the zoo in the car.  The first thing they saw was a zoo worker carrying a pail of fish.  He was going to feed the penguins.  The penguins looked funny walking on land but were very fast swimmers in the water.  Next, the girls ran to where the pandas live.  The pandas were playing by rolling down the hill.  After watching the pandas, the girls and their father moved to where the lions were.

"There were four brothers that lived together in a small house on the east side of town.  The brothers' names were Bob, Billy, Bryan and Baker.  Each brother was one year in age.  The oldest brother Bob was nine, the second eight, the third seven and the youngest was only six.  Each boy also had something that they were good at that no one else could do.  Baker, the youngest boy was good at magic tricks. Bob was the basketball star, Billy was great at football and Bryan was good at baseball. Each boy liked to watch the others show off their skills.  One afternoon Baker put on a magic show.  For this trick he would need three things.  First, he needed four cups each a different color.  The cups colors were green, yellow, blue, and white.  He would need one white ball and two helpers which the parents happily volunteered for.  He started by showing his brothers the inside of each cup as well as the normal white ball.  He then placed the white ball inside the white cups and moved them around really fast.  Next his parents covered the four cups with a magic blanket.  Baker said some magic words and then his helpers removed the blanket.  To his brothers amazement there were only the three colored cups left.  Each brother got to look under a cup.  After flipping up each cup they saw that there was no white ball.  Just a single green ball inside the green cup!  How did you do that they yelled!  A magician never gives up his secrets.

"Billy and Sara are brother and sister. They went to the beach with their family last July for a week, and had the best time ever!  On Monday, Billy and Sara wanted to build a giant sandcastle.

They hoped that they could make the sandcastle taller than themselves, but they soon found they needed more help. They asked their cousin Joey to help them build the biggest sandcastle in the world! Joey wasn't the friendliest cousin in the world, but to Billy and Sara's surprise, Joey was happy to help build the sandcastle.

They were so happy! \tab  The rest of the week at the beach was a lot of fun for Billy and Sara. On Tuesday, they went for ice cream.

"It was time for Jill to make her famous apple pie, out of the yellow apples that grew on her land. It was not time to pick the red cherries, or the orange oranges or even the green lettuce, but their nice colors made Jill happy. She would eat some of the pies, and give the rest of them away to her friends and family. She went out to her back yard where the apple trees were, and started picking. A few hours later, she had enough to make dozens of pies. She walked into the kitchen with her apples, and was all ready to start baking when she saw she was all out of flour. She would have to go to the store to get some, since you can't make a pie without flour. While she was at the store, she would also buy some cheese, bread, and milk. She did not need these to make pie, but she did need them to make her dinner. At the store Jill ran into her friends Bob and Steve and George, and told them she would make them all pies.

"Every day at noon, when it was time for recess, Mrs. Snooter would honk a loud horn. This was the signal that told her third grade class to go outside and start playtime.  The students in Mrs. Snooter's class always tried to get to the front of the line in order to make sure they were the first outside. As soon as the doors opened, the whole class would race to the seesaw at the back of the playground. However, it was not an easy race. There were many things between the door and the seesaw that needed to be passed, and Mrs. Snooter's third grade class enjoyed the excitement that they added to the race.  First, the students had to pass the kindergartener's sandbox. This may sound simple, but the kindergarteners would often trap students by digging large holes in the sandbox. If students jumped over the holes, they might have sand thrown in their eyes.  If a student could pass the sandbox test, the next problem was the jungle gym. The fifth grade class came to recess before Mrs. Snooter's class and would hang out on top of the jungle gym. They thought they were cool because they were the oldest kids in the whole school, and would not let any other classes come near the jungle gym. It was difficult, but some students in Mrs. Snooter's class would make it past.  Finally, there was a long run to the seesaw. Only a few students would still be racing at this point, and they would run as fast as they could. Every day, there was one boy who would push himself a little harder than the other students. Most of the time, he was the winner of the race, and would play on the seesaw with his friends. Which of the following grades did not share recess with Mrs. Snooter's class?",third grade,fifth grade,kindergarten,second grade,D

"There once was an alligator named Albert (who wore an office shirt). He had two good friends - Lock the cat and Gary the hamster. Gary often rode around in Albert's shirt pocket, since it would be hard for him to keep up with Albert and Lock as they walked around. One day, as they were wandering around, a storm popped up, forcing them to hurry indoors to deal with it. Unfortunately for them, they couldn't find a building quickly, so they ended up being frosted over by the dangerous weather. ""If we don't get out of this soon, I might die!"" yelled Gary, who was cold. ""Don't worry, no one's going to die!"" yelled Albert, who, as a reptile, was even worse off than Gary. Luckily, they found a house after leaving the forest, which happened to be near the ocean. They ran inside, and dried off, before they headed to sleep.

"There was once a pig named Oink, who lived on a farm, but spent most of his days in a factory making shoes. In his free time, he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly. He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true. For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star. He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said. The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react. He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings. Oink's dream was finally coming true.

He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm. But the birds told him that they saw how much he enjoyed flying, and would allow him to keep his wings so he could fly with them whenever he wanted.

There were many ducks, frogs, birds and chipmunks playing around the pond.  In fact, one of the chipmunks even came up and stole Kevin's car keys when he was eating!  Kevin knew that he needed to go have his keys, but the chipmunk ran with an evil smile on its face.  Eventually, the chipmunk ran into its hole that he called home.  Kevin tried everything he could to have the chipmunk come out with his keys, but he couldn't find out how to make the little guy give up.  Finally, Jessica came over and placed a potato chip at the opening to the hole.  In seconds, the chipmunk came out with the keys and dropped them in front of Kevin right before grabbing the chip and running back into the hole.

"Sally always loved the ocean. Whenever her parents would talk about going to the beach, she would get so excited that she couldn't sleep the night before. Tonight was one of those nights. As she lay in bed, Sally couldn't help but think of all the fun things she would be doing the next day. She would build sand castles, splash in the water, and play Frisbee with her older brother, Jared. All of theses thoughts and more raced through her head, until finally she fell asleep. In the early hours of the morning, Sally awoke to her brother making loud noises in her ear. He was so annoying. A little bit later, her mother and father came in the room, helping Sally and Jared get ready for the day.

The family left with smiles on their faces, ready to have a great day at the beach. What flavor of frozen yogurt did Sally choose?",Mint chocolate chip.,Tropical Turtle.,Strawberry.,Chocolate.,B

"A tiger named Timmy and Bear named Buster were going for a walk in the park by the river and were going to go swim later.

"Tomorrow is my best friend's birthday and I don't know what to get him. He's eleven years old like me, and to be honest, everyone likes to always mix us up. It's not that we look alike or sound alike or even dress alike, but it's our names, Tim and Tom, that do it. Anyways, he likes dinosaurs, board games, and toy cars so I'm not sure if anything under ten dollars has both of those in it. He also told me not to get anything that has feathers included in it as his mom always gets headaches when she's around them.  My mom took me to the store and I looked around for something Tom would like. We had to pass through the clothing, medicine, and jewelry sections before we got to the toy aisle. My mom told me to not let her forget that we need to go to the garden section to get a new sprinkler before we go, but I was too into the toys to understand her. Finally, I found a board game where you play as different cars to try and finish a race first and thought that was perfect even without the dinosaurs. From there, we checked out and I gave the present to Tom on his birthday. He loved it and we played with our other friends, Daryl, John, and Angie. Sadly our other friend, James couldn't make it as he was sick, but we still had so much fun together. How are Tim and Tom mixed up by others?",Their names sound alike,They sound alike,They dress alike,They look alike,A

"Kerry was playing with his toy airplane in the backyard after school one day when he saw something moving in the corner of the yard. He put down his toy and went over to look. He found a small frog, about two inches cross, jumping across the grass.  Carefully, Kerry followed the frog as it jumped across the grass. He didn't know where the frog had come from or where it was going, but he knew that frogs needed water. He wanted to help the frog.  He ran inside and got a plastic pail that he used to use at the beach for sand. He filled it up with water and brought it to the backyard.  It took him some time to find the frog again. It seemed to be moving slower than it had before. He waited for it to pause, then scooped it up with his bare hands and dropped it into the water. He watched the frog swim around for a bit, and then carried the pail around to the front of the house.  It was a short way to a nearby creek running through his neighborhood. Kerry walked slowly, trying not to spill the water. The pail seemed to grow heavier and heavier as he walked. Finally, he reached the creek. He set the pail down next to the water and tipped it over until the frog was swimming in the stream. What did Kerry normally use the pail to carry?",grass,water,frogs,sand,D

"Once upon a time there was a blue spider named Twinkle Toes. All spiders have to get rid of their old skin in order to grow a new, larger skin. Twinkle Toes was a very special kind of spider because his tenth new skin would be pink instead of blue. When it was time for Twinkle Toes to turn pink, he was very excited, but he was also worried. He was afraid that his best friend, an orange cat named Morty Roo, wouldn't know that the pink spider was Twinkle Toes in his new skin. He was scared that Morty Roo would mistake him for a normal spider who does not change colors. If Morty Roo saw a spider who wasn't Twinkle Toes, he would likely kill the spider and eat it. Twinkle Toes was hoping to tell Morty Roo that he would soon turn pink, but Morty Roo didn't come around to visit that day. Twinkle Toes called over Woofington, the neighbor's dog.  Twinkle Toes asked Woofington to please tell Morty Roo that he would be pink after he grew his new skin but would still be the same Twinkle Toes he had always been.

Because it was so important to Twinkle Toes, Woofington said he would deliver the message. Woofington had a special respect for spiders because they eat other bugs.

"Max is a very happy cow. He's dark brown, with big blue eyes, and a soft pink nose.  He lives in a huge field during the summer, with beautiful, and tasty, buttercups and hay.  During the winter he lives in a nice, warm barn.   The hay isn't as tasty then, but it keeps him fed until summer comes back.  One winter day Max wanted to see what was happening outside when it turned cold and bright. He had never gone out during the winter because the Farmer always locked the barn door behind him. But today the door was wide open, and Max could see the sunshine reflecting off the bright ground. He had to know why! So Max pushed open the gate to his little house with his nose and walked over to the door. Max was surprised and confused by the ground outside, it was so white and sparkly. His breath started fogging in the air, and the ground was cold and crunchy. ""What is this?"" He asked the rooster sitting on the fence. The roosters name was Omaha, and he was all white except for a big red puff on his head.    ""It's snow, son! Did you grow up in a barn?!"" The rooster laughed and flew away towards his little rooster house.   ""It's so pretty!"" Max said. He pushed it with his nose. ""Oh! It's so chilly!"" He started to take a bite of the crunchy white bits. He wanted to see if they had a good taste, when he heard the farmer.   ""Max! What are you doing out here?"" The farmer, named Bob, asked. He was loud, but not mad. ""It's much too cold for a small cow like you, we better get you back inside!"" He pushed Max inside the barn, and this time locked the barn door tight. What did Max think of the snow?",That it was made of powder.,That the farmer was mad.,That it tasted good.,That it was cold and pretty.,D

"As Michael put each finger on the white laces of the football like his dad had shown him he thought about his school trip to the zoo tomorrow. He could not wait to get to the zoo and most of all could not wait to see his favorite animal, the lion. Aiming the football at the tire swing that hung in his back yard, he remembered the second thing his dad had taught him about throwing a football which was making sure his shoulder and the football were in a straight line before he threw it. He watched the football sail toward the tire, right as his mom called him in for dinner. His mom had made his favorite food, hotdogs. He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog. His mom told him that in order to get his after dinner treat he would have to eat his corn, carrots, and drink all of his milk too.   That night as his mom tucked him in to bed he starred out the window and wondered if the lions at the zoo were looking up at the moon too. Michael, wondered if his best friends Joe, Nick, and Ryan were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day. He closed his eyes and went to sleep.  The next day he hopped from one foot to the other as his class lined up to get on the bus that would take him to the zoo. On the bus he sat with Ryan. The bus driver started the engine and turned the big steering wheel leading them out on to the road. Finally, at the zoo Michael began to imagine how cool it would be to finally get to see the lion cage. First his class went to see the monkeys and then headed over to see the long necked giraffes. As their teacher announced that they would then be going to see the elephants, we wondered if he would ever get to see the lions. Finally after learning about the elephants it was time to see the lions. The lion stood on a huge rock and swung its long tail from side to side. The lion licked his lips with its long pink tongue and Michael wondered if it was thinking about having a class full of kids for its lunch. What 2 things did Michael's dad teach him about throwing a football?",How to hold the football with both hands and keep his eyes wide open when he threw the football.,How to put his fingers on the laces and how to keep his shoulder and the football in a straight line before he threw it.,How to use his wrist to throw the football straight and how to close one eye before he threw it.,How to look at the tire before he threw the football and how to stand up straight.,B

Michael, wondered if his best friends Joe, Nick, and Ryan were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day. He closed his eyes and went to sleep.  The next day he hopped from one foot to the other as his class lined up to get on the bus that would take him to the zoo. On the bus he sat with Ryan. The bus driver started the engine and turned the big steering wheel leading them out on to the road. Finally, at the zoo Michael began to imagine how cool it would be to finally get to see the lion cage. First his class went to see the monkeys and then headed over to see the long necked giraffes. As their teacher announced that they would then be going to see the elephants, we wondered if he would ever get to see the lions. Finally after learning about the elephants it was time to see the lions. The lion stood on a huge rock and swung its long tail from side to side. The lion licked his lips with its long pink tongue and Michael wondered if it was thinking about having a class full of kids for its lunch. What was the name of the main character in the story?",Joe,Nick,Ryan,Michael,D
"As Michael put each finger on the white laces of the football like his dad had shown him he thought about his school trip to the zoo tomorrow. He could not wait to get to the zoo and most of all could not wait to see his favorite animal, the lion. Aiming the football at the tire swing that hung in his back yard, he remembered the second thing his dad had taught him about throwing a football which was making sure his shoulder and the football were in a straight line before he threw it. He watched the football sail toward the tire, right as his mom called him in for dinner. His mom had made his favorite food, hotdogs. He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog.

"Bobby got a big surprise when he came home from school one day. He found an angel in his room. His grandma had always told him angels were real. Bobby had not believed her when she told him stories. She had also told him stories about mermaids, Bigfoot, leprechauns, and other things. Now, he knew at least one thing she had told him was true. He thought angel wings had to be white. This angel's feathers were many colors. They were red, blue, and green. No white ones that he could see. They looked at each other without speaking. Then, the angel began to talk. He told Bobby he had to listen to his grandma, and believe her stories. Bobby said he would. Bobby asked the angel what it was like to fly. The angel told Bobby it could show him. Bobby would have to beat it at a game. Bobby hoped it would be checkers or chess. His dad had taught him those. He was also good at card games. Instead, the angel wanted to play rock-paper-scissors. Bobby beat the angel two out of three times, so he won. Bobby and the angel then went for a long ride. After they flew, the angel dropped Bobby back at home. It told Bobby he had to promise not to tell anyone. Bobby asked if that included his grandma, mother, brother, and father. The angel said it did. Bobby said he would. The angel left. They met a few more times and became good friends. What does Bobby find in his room?",A leprechaun.,Bigfoot.,A mermaid.,An angel.,D

"Bobby was a little barn mouse and loved to sleep on a blanket. Every day in the morning, Bobby would wake up and fold his little blue blanket that he slept on. Bobby's uncle Arthur got the blanket for Bobby from in the big house. Bobby loved this blanket more than any other thing he had. Bobby had a lot of neat stuff. He had a penny, a safety pin and an earring. He found all of these when he would walk through the forest in the afternoon. Bobby's uncle Arthur would always take walks with him through the forest, to make sure that Bobby didn't get in any trouble.

When held by a human, it is believed to have given the human special powers that would allow them to take over the skies and the sea. Because of its dangerous power, a king named Ogthar wanted to hide the wand on a planet where no one could find it. Before Ogthar went out to hide his wand, he had to tie his shoelaces. Instead of tying them with his hands, he waved the wand to make it do it for him. Instead of tying his shoes, the wind and sky blew the shoes right off of Ogthar. Ogthar cried and cried because he no longer had shoes. After 17 days of crying, Ogthar saw that his life was not terrible without shoes, because he still had a magical wand. Ogthar then forgot about his shoes and instead made a magical land called ""Wind and Sky Land"" for children to gather and play in the fun wind and seas. Ogthar forgot about his shoes after a couple of years and even went on to go to school and get smarter. Ogthar is now a fireman and is glad that he never hid the wand. He now can never die and whenever he thinks of his shoes, he says to himself ""Stop it!"" Why did Ogthar cry?",He lost his shoes.,He couldn't use the restroom.,He couldn't say goodbye to his friends.,He couldn't blow his nose.,A

"Once there was a group of adventurers who went on an adventure in a place named Hyperion where there was a lot of snow. Their names were Thor, Bravos, and Pierre. Thor and Bravos were from Norway, but Pierre was from Paris, France. Because of where he was from, he wasn't used to the cold. To stay warm, Pierre wore three jackets. One day during their adventure the men saw a strange cave. Thor and Bravos wanted to go inside, but Pierre was afraid. He had heard that a horrible bug monster named Vlastos lived in the caves of Hyperion. Thor and Bravos told him that was only a fairy tale. They told him the only thing he really needed to worry about was hitting his head on a rock in the cave. Finally they got Pierre to go into the cave. Inside there were lots of tunnels. They chose the middle tunnel. The tunnel went down into the earth. After a long time it ended. The men were in a huge room. There were beautiful ice shapes on the walls.

They enjoy it so much that they like to draw silly pictures on to their arms and notebooks showing footballs. Then when the teacher sees them they have to use the pink erasers to erase the drawings. One day Mark was out playing football when he tripped and hurt his knee, the next day Matthew was also playing football when he fell and hurt his arm. Both boys could not play their favorite games now. So to cheer them up, Matthew's parents bought them a new football game they could play at home. When Mark showed up to play, they had also made chocolate chip pancakes as a present to both of them, even if both of their favorite food was bacon, waffles and hamburgers. After some time both boys got bored with the game and thought to build their own. So they got some cardboard and tape and built a small table top football game.

"I'd had the piggy bank for a long time. So long, in fact, that I don't really remember getting it. My aunt once told me a whole story about it, in which it was passed down through the family for many, many years, only to come to me. I was pretty little at the time, so I believed her with no question. It made me think that the bank was important. It became some sort of sign of family and togetherness. I would imagine my mom and my grandmother and even my great grandmother before that, putting coins in the little white pig and waiting for them to fill it up, to be spent on some sort of treasure. And then, when I was fifteen, I broke it.  I didn't mean to. I was cleaning my room in a hurry, so I could finish quickly and go to a friend's house. I swung the vacuum hose around too quickly, knocking the pig's shelf, and down it went. About a thousand pieces, and way fewer coins than I would have believed, flew everywhere. I started to cry.   My mother came in at the sound of the crash.  ""I'm so, so sorry!"" I cried. ""I broke the bank! I broke the family bank!"" ""What, Sarah?"" my mother asked, kneeling next to me on the floor.

"A rabbit was hopping around, following all the smells he could smell. He had a great nose, smelling carrots, bushes, flowers, and other animals. He smelled melons and he smelled a dish of ice cream. Rabbits don't like ice cream, so he moved to the flowers faster. And he didn't really like to snack on melons either. He saw friends, the duckling and the mother duck, but he was moving too fast to get to the flowers. He could smell the flowers from a long way away. He kept hopping to reach them, faster and faster. One hop, two hops, three hops. On his third hop he always bounced a little higher. He finally smelled the flowers close, so he hopped a little bit faster. The flowers were in sight. He went up to them and smelled longer and harder than ever before. A wonderful smell at last. How many hops until the rabbit bounced higher?",Every hop was higher than the last,Four,Three,Two,C

"Corky walked to the store to buy some milk, like he does every Tuesday. On his way, he passed the red house where John lives, the green house where June lives, the white house where Barack lives, the blue hat store, and the orange house where Jessie lives. He finally reached the store at 5 o'clock.   Corky thought about buying some other things too. He looked at the potato chips, but didn't like the flavors they had left. All of the normal flavored ones were gone. He never liked hard candy, so he ignored those. He saw the apples, but didn't need one because he had apples at home. So he picked out some cookies instead. Corky thought he'd eat them on his way home. He waited in line until it was his turn, and then paid Abe the cashier. Abe gave him his change and wished him a good day.  On his way home, Corky ate his cookies. He had hoped to buy peanut butter cookies, but the store never has those. Instead, he bought sugar cookies. He liked them very much too, so he wasn't at all upset. When he got home, he poured a glass of milk and finished his cookies.

"Juno was a very playful dog but she was also very disobedient.     One afternoon Juno was out in the front yard playing tag with Sasha the kitten, when Billy came to fetch her for her bath.  Juno did not like baths very much and she ran away every time Billy got close to her.  Billy soon got tired of Juno's game, so he left her in the garden hoping she would keep running around and tire herself out.   Sasha the kitten followed Billy and Juno was surprised to find herself alone, she had hoped Billy would keep on playing this fun game.   To pass the time she watched some birds building a nest in a tree, Juno was so bored she even tried to play hide and seek with George, the parrot.  Finally, since there was nobody to play with Juno laid down to take a nap. A little later Billy came back out into the yard to fetch Juno.   What Billy didn't know was, Juno had been sleeping since he left and she was ready for another game of catch me if you can, her favorite game.  Juno took off running as soon as she saw Billy.

Billy knew he had to hurry or his brothers Allen and Greg would finish the Rocky Road ice cream which was Billy's favorite. Billy tied Juno's leash to the fence and then he brought the hose over and switched it on.  Juno   immediately tried to run away but she had no choice but to stay there and let Billy soak her.   Billy quickly added soap to Juno's coat and soon she was covered in soapy suds.   Soon Billy once again turned the hose on Juno to rinse all the soap out of her coat.   The last thing to be done was to rub Juno down with a towel and dry her off Once Billy had finished he took the collar and leash off and Juno lay down in the sun happy that bath time was over once again.   Billy went to join the rest of the family and his father said he could choose between Chocolate Chip, Caramel Delight, Cookies and Cream or Rocky Road ice cream.

"His parents were out and dropped him at the babysitter's house at 12 o'clock. Lunchtime had past, but later the babysitter fixed him a dinner of some kind of brown meat. Under the meat was a slice of dry toast. Timmy didn't like the dinner and wished he had spaghetti or pizza. Even if it wasn't what he wanted, the meal filled his tummy and stopped the hunger pains.    Timmy was bored and wanted something to do, but he didn't have any toys. All he had was some paper, his toothbrush and toothpaste. He wished he was home where he had left his favorite toy race car and train. The house was quiet and nighttime was near. He pretended he was camping. It was 8 o'clock and the streetlight came on and shined through the curtain, making scary shadows on the wall.    He looked through the trash in the babysitter's extra room but couldn't find anything useful. If he at least had some markers or crayons he could draw some pictures, but he didn't even have a pencil.   Timmy thought for a bit and found he could make a toy boat. He folded the paper into a mighty ship.   In his imagination the little boat was in a storm on a dark sea. Danger was all around. The imaginary men on his paper boat were facing the storm bravely and sailed into safety as he was falling asleep. What time of day was it when Timmy got bored?",lunchtime,morning,8 o'clock,midnight,C

"The cat woke up from its nap under the couch. Poking his head out from under the couch, there were no dogs there. He walked out from under the couch and stretched out his paws along the hard wood floor. Far outside there was some barking from the dogs, but he was safe from them for now. The smell of tuna was in the air and the cat followed the scent to the kitchen. A woman was making a tuna sandwich for her two kids. When she finished, she put the tuna can on to the floor. The cat slowly walked up to the can and saw some juice inside. He licked up the yummy tuna juice and was sad when it was all gone. The woman brought the tuna sandwiches over to her sons at the table, then she opened the back door to let the dogs in. The cat's fur stood on end as the dogs came running after him.

"Once upon a time, there was a little white mouse that lived on a farm. He liked to hide in the hay stacks where it was warm through the day and night. On cold winter days, he would wiggle out from the hay stack to get closer to the lamp in the barn, getting some extra warmth. One winter day, the mouse was very cold, but needed something to eat. He left the hay stack, and ran past the lamp. He ran across an old wood board that was laying on top of the snow - the mouse didn't have mittens and wanted to keep his feet warm. He ran and ran until he couldn't any longer. The cold weather was keeping every living thing inside, so the mouse was all alone. He walked towards the house and met a little bug named Fred. Fred told the mouse that he went inside and found lots of crumbs to eat on the kitchen floor. The mouse waited until the farmer's wife, Julie, came out the back door, and then the mouse ran into the kitchen. There were bread crumbs everywhere! The mouse ate as many as he could before anyone found him. He heard the back door open again, and hid under the oven. It was warm there - there must have been a pie baking. Farmer Bill liked pies more than bread, cake, or cookies. The mouse stayed there to warm up, then ran back to the barn to sleep for the night. Who opened the back door?",The mouse,The farmer's wife,Fred,The farmer,B

"Once there was a fish who had lived his whole life in his bowl. He often got bored and wished to see the rest of the world, but because he was a fish, he couldn't leave the water. So one day he made a special fish suit that would allow him to walk on land and breathe air like humans. He knew this would change his life, and make him rich, but first he would have to test it out.  He put the suit on and leaped from the bowl that until now had been his whole world. The suit worked! Now he could go where he wanted.  First he went to the kitchen of the house. There he saw a parrot eating a cracker. Second he went outside to the yard. He saw squirrels there running around looking for food. Third he went to the barn in the field. He saw a mommy cow. She was teaching her calf how to run. Finally he went to forest where he saw more trees than he had ever seen in his whole life.  But after all this he was tired, and made up his mind to go back to his home in the bowl. It was a lot of work trying to see the world. He took off the special suit and splashed back into the water. His suit had passed the test and he was very happy, but he had made up his mind that his bowl was the place for him. Who was eating a cracker in the kitchen?",The parrot.,The fish.,The mommy cow.,The squirrels.,A

"Sam's granddad was going to take Sam and his two brothers, James and Evan on vacation.  They could choose to go to the lake or the beach.  If they chose the lake, they would get to go on their granddad's boat.  If they chose the beach, there would be sand to dig in.  All three boys began to clap and cheer for the beach!  The boys left their house in their granddad's van to drive to the beach.  They drove by their school on the way.  The boys were glad to be out for the summer.  On the road, the boys played a game.  Whoever counted the most big trucks would be the winner.  James counted one hundred and five trucks.  This was more than Sam or Evan counted.  Evan pointed out the window at a man dressed all in black riding a black motorcycle.  The man had a long beard.  When they got to the beach, their granddad told them to put on sunscreen so they would not get sun burned. The boys grabbed their pails and shovels and ran down on to the sand near the water.  Their granddad brought a chair to sit on and a large umbrella to give him shade.  He also brought some noodles for the boys to float on if they went into the water.  Sam found a piece of wood washed up on the beach.  He used it make a bridge over large hole that the boys had dug. Where was Sam's granddad's boat?",The house.,The lake.,The beach.,The school.,B

"I like to go to the park that is next to the hotel. The park is very big and has lots of ladders and slides. My favorite thing to do at the park is to swim in the lake. The lake is small but there are a lot of red fish that live in it. There are also some turtles and worms at the bottom of the lake. Sometimes the fish swim by my leg and make me laugh and feel happy. One time I stepped on a stick and cut my foot. That cut hurt and made me sad. The next time I went in the lake I was scared that I would get another cut. Another thing I like to do at the park is to feed the animals. There are lots of pigs, squirrels and raccoon living in the park. Sometimes I feed them bread and crackers. Their favorite thing to eat is ham. After I am done at the park I go to the store to buy some ice cream. Sometimes I see my friend Christopher and he eats his ice cream with me. Christopher also likes feeding the animals. His favorite animal at the park is the squirrel. How do the fish make me feel?",Sad,Hurt,Scared,Happy,D

"There once was a small boy who liked to wiggle.  He would wiggle everywhere he went. He would wiggle during supper when he was eating his food.  He would wiggle down the winding path outside his house. He could wiggle his right knee when he walked, and that gave his wiggle even more wiggle.  One day, his grandpa was watching the boy wiggle.  His grandpa was old and liked to cough.  He had a long beard that was grey at the top. He was tired of watching the boy wiggle, and thought the boy was wiggling around a little too much. So, his grandpa gave the boy a pea and told him it was a magic pea. He said the magic pea would stop his wiggle. The boy started roaring with laughter. He didn't believe a pea could stop his wiggle.  The grandpa put the pea in a little square bag and tied it around the boy's waist.  The boy tried to wiggle, but he couldn't wiggle at all. All he could do was walk straight. That was no fun. What good was a boy if he couldn't wiggle when he wanted?  The grandpa coughed and smiled. He enjoyed watching the boy not wiggle any more. Why did grandpa give the boy a pea?",The boy was hungry from wiggling.,He found it in his long beard.,He found it in a bag.,It was a magic pea that would stop the boy's wiggle.,D

"There was once a leprechaun named Tony who spent his days at the end of a rainbow guarding his golden bowl of cereal. Tony was one of the toughest leprechauns in all the land, so no one dared to mess with him or try to take his bowl. That is, until an angel named Jess fell from Heaven. Jess had broken her wing, so she had no choice but stay on Earth, and could not return to the sky. So she chose to make the best of it and went to see all of the beautiful and interesting things on Earth. One day, she came across Tony's rainbow, and was amazed by it. She followed the rainbow to the end, wondering what could be there. Then she saw it: Tony's golden bowl. From the time she saw the bowl, she knew she wanted it.  She had heard about how tasty cereal was when she lived in Heaven, but she never tried it for herself. When she went to have some of the cereal, Tony the Leprechaun popped out from behind the rainbow and laughed at her. ""Don't you know,"" he said, ""that I'm the toughest leprechaun in all the land? What makes you think you can eat a box of cereal from my golden bowl?"" The angel saw that he was right, and she couldn't argue with him. So she left to find something to trade. She came across a seesaw which looked very interesting. She thought that Tony might like it, so she brought the seesaw to his rainbow and said, ""I've come bearing a seesaw."" When Tony saw the seesaw, he loved it. He didn't argue or laugh at Jess, and traded for his bowl right there. Jess ate from it, and it was delicious. What did Jess trade for the bowl?",A ticket to Heaven,A box of cereal,Her wings,A seesaw,D

When they were in school one day, their teacher told them the story of the super scary sock monster.  She warned them to stay as far away from the sock monster as they could.

Dig packed a pear.  Mittens packed a banana.  Bub packed a grape.  It took a long time but they finally found the sock monster.  He lived in a cave.  The cave was under the school.  The sock monster was not looking in their direction when they found him.  As quiet as they could, they walked up to him.  Pizza got the camera ready.  Just as Pizza was about to take the picture, Bub tripped over a stick.  The noise caused the sock monster to look at the brave friends.  The sock monster was angry!    ""He looks mad!

"So, there was this kid named Jack that came up to my beanstalk one day. I couldn't believe my eyes, so I put down my ham sandwich I was eating and looked at him. I'm not sure what he thought he was doing there, but he sure did talk a lot. He kept asking me questions about this and then he asked me some questions about that and I was getting a little bit tired of all of the questions.  When I thought I wouldn't hear the end of everything, this Jack kid asked me about the one and only secret that I've always kept to myself. That no one even knew about! No, it wasn't about my golden guitar or even my goose that laid eggs filled with coins. No, he was asking me about my beans and their roots.   You see, I'm a giant and my job is to make sure the bean roots that we use to get down to earth are well protected and guarded. They're what helps us get down to the little person world when we need to. I became a little bit worried as the little kid asked more and more questions about my roots. I didn't want to tell him that my roots were hidden in the library!  I walked over to him to pick this little kid up to get him to quiet down about the bean roots, well, he got me with his little knife and I dropped him! Thankfully, he didn't get hurt or I would've been so sad!   He ran down the beanstalk when I chased after him. I guess he wanted to get back to his little people. I didn't follow him, but I sure hope he doesn't come back for my stuff. What was the secret Jack knew about?",Goose that laid eggs filled with golden coins,A hat,Bean roots,Golden Guitar,C

"I had always had fun playing in the dirt growing up, digging, throwing, building, smashing, everything, so this year for my birthday my mom and dad had bought me a gardening kit to grow my own vegetables. It came with a watering pot, a shovel, a rake and seeds! The next morning we all went out to the backyard to start our garden. We dug a bunch of small holes with my new shovel, put a seed or two in each hole, and covered them up with dirt and raked over them. Our dog was very confused because he's the one that digs the holes. Every day I would get so excited to water them and see how big they'd gotten. Every day they would get even bigger. That was the most exciting part! Then they started making little tomatoes, and they sort of looked like grapes. And those too got bigger and bigger and started turning red. This was all very exciting and finally by Christmas my dad and I picked our fresh tomatoes and washed them to be eaten in a salad with dinner. what did he get the seeds for?",Christmas,for eating his dinner,his birthday,Mother's Day,C

"There once was a wolf that liked to scare the other forest animals. By daylight he pretended to be a kind, nice wolf. By night, he would circle the forest and hunt down his food.

The wolf liked to watch his food run in circles like a hamster until he felt like eating it. Sometimes the wolf would stay in the sand and lay in the sun until he would crawl back to his home and fall asleep with a full stomach. On other days, he goes home hungry. Sometimes there would be a knock on his door, and the wolf would be pleased because it meant his dinner had come to him and he would not have to hunt that day.

"I couldn't believe today had come! It was finally my birthday and that meant I could start working at the nearby pet store. First off, let me say that my name is Lilly, and as I'm sure you know, today's my birthday! Working at the pet shop has been my dream ever since I was a little girl, so actually getting to work with and help take care of the kitties, puppies, lizards and all sorts of animals is the coolest thing to happen to me. Some people dream of being a doctor, or a nurse, or even a teacher, but I've always wanted to work with pets. I'll say, like many people, I do have fears and that fear is snakes so I won't get to take care of them!  \tabI arrived at the pet store around nine in the morning and was greeted by the friendly woman that owned it who I talked with over the phone. Her hair was covering her name tag so I couldn't tell if her name was Martha, Margaret, or Mary, but it turns out she told me it was Margie so none of them were right. Margie helped me become friendly with all the animals, and I had so much fun the whole day. I fed them, gave them water, and even got to play with them! Margie didn't think I was ready to clean up after them yet so she said that could be done another day. It was everything I ever hoped and I can't wait for tomorrow! What has Lilly always wanted to do?",Work with pets.,Become a nurse,Become a doctor,Become a teacher,A

"One summer when I was sixteen, I planted a vegetable garden. I wanted a bunch of different vegetables, so I planted seven tomato plants, three pepper plants, six corn plants, and two cucumber plants. My mom loves zucchini so I also planted ten zucchini plants. I watered the garden daily with a watering can. When weeds started to take over, I pulled them back. About a month in, I started getting fresh vegetables every day. I walked to the garden with a big basket every morning and picked the vegetables that were ready. Sometimes I ate them right off the vine. One day I walked down to the garden and saw that the zucchini plants were taking over. Each of my ten plants had many zucchini, giving me hundreds of zucchinis each week. I didn't know what to do with the zucchini so I gave some to my neighbor. I gave some to my parents to take to their friends. Then I went door to door and gave zucchini to everyone in the neighborhood. Who did I give the zucchini to?",my neighbors and my friends,"my neighbors, my parents' friends, and everyone in the neighborhood",my friends,my parents' friends,B

"Many, many years back, in a place full of magic, there lived a man and a woman who were married. The man and woman did not love one another or anything else. The man was a wood man and often spent days alone in the wood. One day the man spent more time in the wood and he became lost. After days and days he grew hungry and weak. When he thought for sure he was going to die a tall wizard appeared before him. The man did not know the wizard had placed a spell on him, making him get lost, but he did.  The wizard smiled at the man in a friendly way and said to him, ""I can show you the way out of the woods, if you give me the one thing you love most in the world.""  Since there was nothing that the man loved, he said yes at once. The Wizard showed the man the way home and then disappeared into the wood. The man and woman lived well for many years and the man never told his meeting to the wizard and after a time, he too forgot about his promise.   In time the woman gave birth and the man had a daughter who he loved. One day the wizard came to the door to take the girl, making the man remember his promise. The man was very sad to lose his daughter. But in the end he had to give her over to the wizard. The wizard was bad and locked the girl away in a cave.

"One hot summer day in August my family and I wanted to go to the beach.  We had not gone to the beach in a very long time and felt that today was a great day to do it.   We piled everyone into the car-my mom, my dad, my sister, my dog, and me. I begged mom and dad to let me sit in the front seat, but they said no.  I had to sit next to the smelly dog instead for the whole trip.   When we got to the beach and opened the car door our dog raced down to the water to play. I grabbed the large umbrella we brought and walked down to the sand with mom and dad. After we had found a spot, they let me go play in the water.   It felt really good to cool off in the ocean water on such a hot day. As I swam around I saw many cool things, like fish, seaweed, and shells. I brought the interesting shells that I found to a bucket I had on the beach and threw them in. They would be great to add to my collection at home.  When I got tired of swimming, my sister and I wanted to make a sand castle. We built towers using buckets and dug a huge ditch with our shovels. When our castle was complete we were about to take a picture, but then the dog ran it over and smashed it. I was about to yell at the dog, but then mom said it was getting late and we had to go home.  When we got home I was wiped out from playing all day, so I went to sleep almost immediately. It was a very good day that I'll always remember. Why did the dog almost get yelled at?",The dog was almost yelled at for sitting in the seat for the whole trip.,The dog was about to get yelled at for smashing the sand castle.,The dog was almost yelled at for racing down to the water to play.,The dog was almost yelled at for digging a huge ditch.,B

"Once there was a young girl named Angel.  Angel was very nervous because she was about to give a speech for school.  The student that gave the best speech would win free tickets to see the fireworks.  Angel had spent a lot of time practicing her speech because she really wanted to win.  She practiced in front of her cousin, Noah.  She practiced in front of her stuffed tiger, Kitten.  She practiced saying her speech as she stood on one leg and looked at the ceiling.  She even practiced burping her speech!  Despite all that practice, Angel was still very nervous.  So many other kids were giving speeches that day and they all were going to try their best!  As Angel was walking in to the school she saw a penny on the ground.  Her mother had always told her that pennies were lucky so she picked it up.  With the penny in her hand she felt less nervous.  It was her new lucky coin.  When Angel's turn came she gave her speech.  She remembered all of the words to her speech and she remembered to smile at the right times.  Her hard work and her lucky coin worked.  She won the free fireworks tickets!  Angel's teacher, Mr. Coffee, was so proud of her that he turned her lucky coin into a necklace.  Angel wore it everywhere she went from then on.  The fireworks were pretty cool too. What is the young girl's name?",Kitten,Mr. Coffee,Noah,Angel,D

Maria had worked in the past at schools in California, Texas, and Vermont, but had to leave these schools because the school in Arizona was perfect for her dream job. When she moved to Arizona she found a small little one bedroom house that fit her perfectly. The house was on the top floor of another building, owned by another teacher. In her house was a bed, dresser, table and telephone. Nothing else came with the house. So Maria wanted to go shopping with her new teacher friend. So they went down to the mall to buy things for her new house. First she wanted to look for some chairs to go with her table. Then she wanted to find a TV for her living room and a TV for her bedroom. Last she wanted to find a big comfy couch for her living room.

She could buy the middle couch right at her limit, which was brown. Or she could buy the smallest couch well under her limit, but was not a very good color, red. Maria went with the middle couch knowing she would not like the color of the smaller one even if it was least expensive. Maria then had to choose if she wanted them to deliver her couch or if she would pick it up. Knowing she had only a small car she went with the deliver choice. She also had to choose if she wanted them to set up the couch for her or for her to set it up herself. She went with them setting it up since they would be there to deliver it anyway.

At camp there weren't any restaurants or grocery stores, so for food they would have to make their own meals. One thing they could do is make peanut butter sandwiches, which every scout was given at the start of camp. But pretty soon everyone was sick of peanut butter sandwiches and wanted to eat something else instead. Some boys went out into the forest and picked out berries and roots that were safe to eat. Some boys even took out the boat and went fishing. They came back with a big fish that they cleaned and cooked themselves.  At first, Frank's mom was very worried about letting Frank go to camp. She was worried that he could get lost in the woods and be eaten by a bear. She was worried that he might get into a fight with the other boys. She was even worried that he wouldn't shower or take a bath for the whole two weeks. But Frank's scout masters explained to Frank's mom that the camp leaders were very serious about taking care of the campers and that everything would be perfectly safe for Frank. Frank promised to call home at least every two days. So in the end Frank's mom let Frank go to camp.
